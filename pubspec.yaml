flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - images/info.png
   - images/icone1.png
   - images/backer_0001.jpg
   - images/backer_0002.jpg
   - images/backer_0003.jpg
   - images/backer_0004.jpg
   - images/backer_0005.jpg
   - images/backer_0006.jpg
   - images/fundo_0001.jpg
   - images/fundo_0002.jpg
   - images/fundo_0003.jpg
   - images/fundo_0004.jpg
   - images/fundo_0005.png
   - images/fundo_0006.jpg
   - images/eu_amo_pao.png
   - images/eu_amo_pao_v2.png
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
   - family: Lobster
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/Lobster-Regular.ttf
         style: italic
   - family: Poppins
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
         weight: 600
       - asset: fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
         weight: 400
#   - family: Trajan Pro
#     fonts:
#       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
#         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies, 
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
